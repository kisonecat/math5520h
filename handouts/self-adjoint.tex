\maketitle

A \textbf{spectral theorem} is a theorem providing conditions for when
a linear operator can be diagonalized.

In what follows, $V$ is a finite dimensional inner product space over
the complex numbers and $f$ is a self-adjoint linear operator on $V$.

\begin{problem}
  What does it mean to say that $f : V \to V$ is self-adjoint?
\end{problem}

\vfill

\begin{problem}
  Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $f$.  Is ${E_\lambda}^\perp$ an invariant subspace of $f$?
\end{problem}

\vfill

\begin{problem}
  The operator $f$ can be diagonalized.
%  There is an orthonormal basis of $V$ consisting of eigenvectors of
%  $f$ for which the corresponding eigenvalues are real.
\end{problem}

\vfill

\begin{problem}
  All eigenvalues of $f$ are real.
\end{problem}

\vfill

\begin{problem}
  There is an orthonormal basis for $V$ consisting of eigenvectors of $f$.
\end{problem}

\vfill

\begin{problem}
  Formulate a related theorem for symmetric matrices with
  \textit{real} entries.  (\textit{Warning:} How do you know there is an eigenvector?)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  The operator $f$ is self-adjoint iff for all $\vec{v} \in V$ we have $\langle f(\vec{v}),\vec{v} \rangle \in \mathbb{R}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  If for all $\vec{v} \in V$ we have $\langle f(\vec{v}, \vec{v} \rangle = 0$, then $f = 0$.
\end{problem}
