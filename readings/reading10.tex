\maketitle

We've already met the \textbf{inner product} but this week, we dig
deeper into inner products, and make connections between this topic
and many of the things we've studied before (e.g., our exploration of
Legendre polynomials from the end of last week). To get started, open
\textit{Linear Algebra: An Introductory Approach} and review
\textsection 15 Inner products.  You may also want to consult Axler's
\textit{Linear Algebra Done Right} and read
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsection 6.A Inner Products and Norms
\item \textsection 6.B Orthonormal Bases
\item \textsection 6.C Orthonormal Complements and Minimization Problems
\item \textsection 7.A Self-Adjoint and Normal Operators
\end{itemize}
Note that last topic: we will study self-adjoint operators which
suggests by lecture theory that we will study \textbf{adjoint
  operators}\footnote{Last week, we used Cramer's rule, which involved a
certain matrix of cofactors which nowadays is called the
\textbf{adjugate matrix} but \textit{used} to be called the adjoint.
These things have (or rather had\ldots) the same name, but they're not
related, and similar names for different things are often a point of
confusion.}.  Inner products will lead us to consider \textbf{norms} on vector
spaces, and in particular to prove that all norms on finite
dimensional spaces are equivalent.  We will see the \textbf{Schur decomposition} and the \textbf{QR decomposition} as well as unitary and Hermitian matrices.

Thinking about inner products also leads us to \textbf{bilinear forms}
and to \textbf{linear functionals,} which  reminds us about
\textbf{dual spaces}.  For more on dual spaces, open \textit{Linear
  Algebra: An Introductory Approach} and read
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsection 26 Quotient spaces and dual vector spaces
\item \textsection 27 Bilinear forms and duality
\end{itemize}
You will also find these topics in \textit{Linear Algebra Done Right}
in \textsection 3.E Products and Quotients of Vector Spaces and
\textsection 3.F Duality.  Pay special attention to the finite dimensional \textbf{Riesz representation theorem}.

In addition to this ``conceptual'' content, there is, as usual, a
``computational'' goal for the week.  For this week, be prepared to
apply the \textbf{Gram-Schmidt procedure.}
