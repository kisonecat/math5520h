After our short week in which we met the many faces of the
determinant, we can now return to differential equations and to the
study of the Wronskian.  But to what end?  Gian-Carlo Rota writes ``In
an elementary course in differential equations, students should learn
a few basic concepts that they will remember for the rest of their
lives, such as the universal occurrence of the exponential function,
stability, the relationship between trajectories and integrals of
systems, phase plane analysis, the manipulation of the Laplace
transform, perhaps even the fascinating relationship between partial
fraction decompositions and convolutions via Laplace transforms.  Who
cares whether the students become skilled at working out tricky
problems?''  What will you remember from this course for the rest of
your lives?

Look to the case of linear equations with variable coefficients, which
is in Chapter~3 of \textit{An Introduction to Ordinary Differential
  Equations} by Coddington, namely
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsection 3.2 Initial value problems for the homogeneous equation
\item \textsection 3.3 Solutions of the homogeneous equation % 1, 2
\item \textsection 3.4 The Wronskian and linear independence % 1
\item \textsection 3.5 Reduction of the order of a homogeneous equation % 1(ac) 4
\item \textsection 3.6 The non-homogeneous equation % 1
\item \textsection 3.7 Homogeneous equations with analytic coefficients % 2, 5
\item \textsection 3.8 The Legendre equation % 9
\end{itemize}
We are all very happy to see the Wronskian again, and remarkably many
of its previous wonderful properties will be reprised in this context.

Finally, you may be amused to look back at some very old textbooks and
consider how much is unchanged.  Some to consider are Abraham Cohen's
\textit{An elementary treatise on differential equations} from 1906,
or George Boole's \textit{A treatise on differential equations} from
1859.  What would you say to a student in 2124 being told to read
Coddington's text?
