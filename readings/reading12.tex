\maketitle

This week is different because instead of meeting in-person five days,
instead on Tuesday we have our ``asynchronous day of learning.'' Use
the asynchronous day of learning to focus on your reading: there are
significant reading expectations in this course! This week's content
is more conceptually involved than the fairly ``computational'' tasks
last week, so reading will be particularly important. Take time to
reflect on your past learning and to make connections between the
linear algebra and differential equations content. I am so impressed
at how well these two topics get mixed together in this course.

Our time in four days of lecture will focus on digging into some
linear algebra which we have seen \textit{shadows} of, but not yet discussed in
depth in class.  One of these topics are various constructions for new
vector spaces; we've seen the direct sum $V \oplus W$, and we've seen
how $\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)$ is a vector space, but another construction is
that of \textbf{quotient spaces}, which you can review in Axler's
\textit{Linear Algebra Done Right} in \textsection 3.E Products and
Quotients of Vector Spaces, or in Curtis' \textit{Linear Algebra: An
  Introductory Approach} in \textsection 26 Quotient spaces and dual
vector spaces.

\textbf{Duality} is a topic we've seen, but a deeper study will
provide opportunities to reinforce your knowledge of linear algebra.
From \textit{Linear Algebra Done Right}, study \textsection 3.F
Duality; from \textit{Linear Algebra: An Introductory Approach}, study
the aforementioned \textsection 26 and also \textsection 27 Bilinear
forms and duality.  For a ``computational'' review task this week,
recall how to start with some reasonable basis (say, a basis of
monomials for polynomials of bounded degree) and find a dual basis.

Through duality, we will be led to review our short-lived experience
with \textbf{indices} which will lead us to brief foray into tensor
products $V \otimes W$ and into \textbf{biilinear maps}, making
connections to inner product spaces and perhaps even to \textbf{wedge
  products}, which we first mentioned when thinking about a basis-free
description of the \textbf{determinant.}

At the end of the week, armed with all this, we will study linear
functionals on spaces of polynomials, i.e., \textbf{the umbral
  calculus}, so-named for its power in proving ``shadowy'' identities
involving polynomials, e.g., behold the syntactic similarity between
\[
 \frac {d}{dx} x^{n}=n\,x^{n-1} \mbox{ and } {\frac {d}{dx}}B_{n}(x)=n \, B_{n-1}(x),
\]
where $B_n$ denotes the $n$th Bernoulli polynomial.
