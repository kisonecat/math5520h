For this week, we finally begin the study of \textit{differential
  equations}.  Recall that at the beginning of this course---back in
Week 1---we studied systems of linear equations.  Both ``differential
equations'' and ``linear equations'' include the word ``equations''
but the connection between these two subjects certainly runs much
deeper than this.  Be prepared to make analogies and connections!

Our computations for this week will focus on linear equations with
constant coefficients.  Skim through the beginning of \textit{An
  Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations} by Coddington, and
then focus on
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsection 2.2 The second order homogeneous equation
\item \textsection 2.3 Initial value problems for second order equations
\item \textsection 2.4 Linear dependence and independence
\item \textsection 2.5 A formula for the Wronskian
\item \textsection 2.6 The non-homogeneous equation of order two
\item \textsection 2.7 The homogeneous equation of order $n$
\item \textsection 2.8 Initial value problems for $n$-th order equations
\end{itemize}

Your problem set for this week will make an analogy between shift
operators and differential equations, and I hope you will spend time
reflecting on the power of linear algebra in providing a framework
broad enough to encompass so much ``linear'' phenomena.  Next week,
motivated by our study of differential equations, we meet eigenvectors
for the first time.

I should emphasize that the ``interweaving'' of topics we are
attempting in this course is both challenging and important.
Gian-Carlo Rota once wrote: ``The sophomore course in differential
equations will never be reformed.  It will die of natural death, and
it will be replaced by several shorter courses that will deal with
realistic aspects of differential equations.''  We will revisit
differential equations over the remainder of the semester, and each
week might be regarded as a short course covering a ``realistic''
aspect of differential equations.  And as Gian-Carlo Rota predicted,
you are not taking a sophomore differential equations course, but
rather a course called ``Linear Algebra and Differential Equations.''
