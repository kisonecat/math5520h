For our second week together, our goal is to move away from examples
involving $\R^n$ and towards vector spaces in general.

More specifically, last week we viewed matrices primarily as an
organizing device for systems of linear equations and we interpreted
solutions of linear equations geometrically through our intuitive idea
of dimension, which seemed to align in various ways with ``rank.''
This week, we provide definitions of dimension (among other things)
and turn our attention to the multiplication of matrices---revealing
that matrices are more than merely a book-keeping device.  (If you are
impatient, next week we will view matrices as encoding \textit{linear
  transformations}.)

To develop your understanding of vector spaces in general, look at
\textit{Linear Algebra: An Introductory Approach} and study
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsection 3 Vector spaces
\item \textsection 4 Subspaces and linear dependence
\item \textsection 5 The concepts of basis and dimension
\item \textsection 7 Some general theorems about finitely generated vector spaces
\end{itemize}
At the speed with which this course moves, it is \textbf{extremely
  important} that you are keeping up with the reading.

Another (terser!) optional reference for this material is Chapters~1
and~2 of \textit{Linear Algebra Done Right} by Sheldon Axler.  If you
want to see a book that highlights matrices (as opposed to linear
transformations), you may enjoy \textit{Matrix Analysis} by Roger Horn
and Charles Johnson.
