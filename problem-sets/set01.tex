\section{Terminology}

\begin{problem}
  What are elementary row operations?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  What is the rank of a matrix?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  What is a vector space?
\end{problem}

\section{Numericals}

row reduce some matrices

\section{Exploration}

\begin{problem}
  Suppose $M$ can be transformed into $N$ by applying elementary row
  operations.  Can you likewise transform $N$ into $M$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  A quadrilateral in the plane $\R^2$ has vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and
  $D$.  Let $M_{\overline{AB}}$ be the midpoint of side
  $\overline{AB}$, and similarly define $M_{\overline{BC}}$ and
    $M_{\overline{CD}}$ and $M_{\overline{DA}}$.  Consider the polygon
        having these four midpoints as its vertices; what sort of
        polygon is it?
\end{problem}

\section{Prove or Disprove and Salvage if Possible}

\begin{problem}
  There exists a nonzero matrix which row reduces to the zero matrix.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  There exists a matrix which is not the identity matrix which row reduces to the identity matrix.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Every diagonal matrix is a multiple of the identity matrix.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  There exists a symmetric matrix which row reduces to a matrix which
  is not symmetric.
\end{problem}
