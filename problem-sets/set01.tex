\section{Terminology}

\begin{problem}\label{terminology:matrix}
  What is a matrix?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  What are elementary row operations?  What does it mean to say that
  two matrices are ``row equivalent'' matrices?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{homogeneous-linear-equations}
  What is a homogeneous system of linear equations?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  What is an augmented matrix?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  What does it mean to say that a matrix is in ``row echelon'' form?  Reduced row echelon form?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{definition-rank}
  What is the rank of a matrix?
\end{problem}

\section{Numericals}

\begin{problem}
  Set $v = (1,2,3)$ and $w = (3,2,1)$ and $u = (1,1,1)$.  Find all real
  numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so that $\alpha v + \beta w = u$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Find all solutions to the following system of linear equations:
  \begin{align*}
    \phantom{}x+y\phantom{+z+w} &= 1, \\
    \phantom{x+}y+z\phantom{+w} &= 2, \\
    \phantom{x+y+}z+w\phantom{} &= 3, \\
    x+\phantom{y+z+}w\phantom{} &= 4.
  \end{align*}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{sin-cos-linear-system}Find all $\alpha, \beta \in \R$ so that for all $x \in \R$ we have $\alpha \sin x + \beta \cos x = 0$.  \textit{Hint:}~Relate this to solving a linear system of equations.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Find all $(x,y,z) \in \R^3$ so that $\alpha^3 x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z = 0$ for $\alpha \in \{1,2\}$.  What if we instead demand the equation holds for $\alpha \in \{1,2,3\}$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{vandermonde-introduction}Pick your favorite real numbers $x$, $y$, $z$ and row reduce the matrix
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x^2 & y^2 & z^2 \\
      x^1 & y^1 & z^1 \\
      x^0 & y^0 & z^0            
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
  Do it again for some other choice of $x$, $y$, $z$.  Any conjectures?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  A certain matrix $M$ is row equivalent to the matrix
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 2 \\
      0 & 1 & 4
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
  Describe the solutions to the homogeneous system of linear equations
  associated to $M$.

\begin{problem}
  Suppose $M$ can be transformed into $N$ by applying elementary row
  operations.  Can you likewise transform $N$ into $M$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{exploration:quadrilateral-midpoints}
  A quadrilateral in the plane $\R^2$ has vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and
  $D$.  Let $M_{\overline{AB}}$ be the midpoint of side
  $\overline{AB}$, and similarly define $M_{\overline{BC}}$ and
  $M_{\overline{CD}}$ and $M_{\overline{DA}}$.  Consider the
  quadrilateral having these four midpoints as its vertices; what sort
  of polygon is it?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Write down a randomly chosen $2$-by-$2$ matrix $M$, and apply row
  operations to find a matrix $N$ in reduced row echelon form which is row
  equivalent to $M$.  What is likely true about $N$?

\section{Prove or Disprove and Salvage if Possible}

\begin{problem}
  The homogeneous system of linear equations $\mathcal{L}(M)$
  associated with the matrix $M$ has a solution set $S$.  If $N$ is
  another matrix row equivalent to $M$, then the solution set to
  $\mathcal{L}(N)$ is also $S$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $M$ and $N$ be matrices which both have $c$ columns, and further
  let $S$ and $T$ be the solution set associated with $\mathcal{L}(M)$
  and $\mathcal{L}(N)$, respectively.  Then the homogeneous system of
  linear equations associated to the block matrix $\begin{pmatrix} M \\
    N \end{pmatrix}$ has solution set $S \cup T$.
\end{problem}
