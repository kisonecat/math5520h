\section{Numericals}


\begin{problem}
  Suppose $p$ is a monic polynomial; write $P$ for the span of $p$ in
  $\R[x]$.

  Consider $V = \R[x]/P$, and define $M : V \to V$ by $M(q + P) = x \cdot q + P$.

  What is the characteristic polynomial of $M$?  The minimal polynomial?
\end{problem}

\section{Exploration}

\begin{problem}
  A focus of our study has been differential equations of the form
  \begin{equation}\label{differential-equation}\tag{$*$}
    y'' + b\, y' + c y = 0
  \end{equation}
  for $b, c \in \R$.  Relate this equation to the equation
  \[
    \frac{d}{dx} \begin{pmatrix} y \\ y' \end{pmatrix} = A \begin{pmatrix} y \\ y' \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  for a certain $2$-by-$2$ matrix $A$.  Can it be that $A$ is similar to
  \(
    \displaystyle\begin{pmatrix} \lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda  \end{pmatrix}
    \)?
    
  Use your knowledge of Jordan canonical form to describe the solutions to \eqref{differential-equation}.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Every complex number $z \in \C$ can be written as
  $z = e^{i \theta}\, r$ for some $r, \theta \in \R$.  Likewise show
  that if $T$ is normal, then $T = UP$ for a unitary operator $U$ and
  a positive operator $P$.  This is the \textbf{polar decomposition}
  of the operator $T$.

  Is this polar decomposition unique?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  For a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over $\R$, suppose
  $f : V \times V \to \R$ is a bilinear form which is symmetric,
  meaning $f(v,w) = f(w,v)$, and positive semidefinite, meaning
  $f(v,v) \geq 0$.

  Define $Z = \{ v \in V : f(v,v) = 0 \}$.  Is $Z$ a subspace of $V$?
  
  Can you use $f$ to construct an inner product on $V/Z$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  By $J_0$, we mean a certain solution to
  \begin{equation}\label{bessel-equation}\tag{$**$}
    x^2 \, y'' + x \, y' + x^2 \, y = 0.
  \end{equation}
  Let $[a,b]$ be an interval on which $J_0(x)$ is positive.  Why is
  there such an interval?

  Then define $Y_0 : [a,b] \to \R$ by 
  \[
    Y_0(x) = J_0(x) \int_a^x \frac{dt}{t \, J_0(x)^2}.
  \]
  Does $Y_0$ satisfy \eqref{bessel-equation}?  Are $J_0$ and $Y_0$
  linearly independent?
\end{problem}

\section{Prove or Disprove and Salvage if Possible}

\begin{problem}
  Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite dimensional vector spaces over a field $k$.

  Then $V \cong W$ if and only if $\dim V = \dim W$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  If $A = (a_{jk}) \in \Mat_{n\times n}(\C)$ has an eigenvalue $\lambda$, then
  there exists $j$ so that
  \[
    \left| \lambda - a_{jj} \right| < \sum_{k \neq j} \left|a_{jk} \right|.
  \]
  (This is the \textbf{Gershgorin circle theorem.})
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Define the operator $L$ by
  \[
    Ly = y'' + b \, y' + c \, y,
  \]
  for $b, c \in \R$.  If $Lf = Lg = 0$ and $f(0) = g(0)$ then $f \equiv g$.
\end{problem}
